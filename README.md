# Cross-Validation

Overfitting means We have fit the model too much to training data, The model trained 'too well' and fit closely to the training data.The model might not be accurate on untrained/new data

To avoid overfitting and to get sense of true model accuracy, we can use KFold cross validation. It's very helpful when you have small dataset
