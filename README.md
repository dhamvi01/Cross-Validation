# Cross-Validation

Overfitting means We have fit too much for training data, The model trained 'too well' and fit closely to the training data.The model might not accurate on untrained/new data

To avoid overfitting and to get sense of true model accuracy, we can use KFold cross validation. It's very helpful when you have small dataset
